This project simulates a simple token management system using JavaScript, mimicking the behavior of a blockchain token smart contract. It includes essential functionalities such as defining token details (name, symbol, and total supply), mapping addresses to their respective token balances, and providing mint and burn operations. The mint function increases the total supply and the balance of a specified address, while the burn function decreases the total supply and the balance of an address, with a condition to ensure sufficient balance before burning. Additionally, a function to check the balance of a given address is included. An example usage demonstrates minting 100 tokens to an address, burning 50 tokens from the same address, and handling errors when attempting to burn more tokens than available. This project provides a foundational understanding of token creation, destruction, and balance management, offering insights into supply and balance operations in a decentralized system.
